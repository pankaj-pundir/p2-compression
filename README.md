# my prompt

I want to write a  compression tool, so create a website which takes in file, using a upload adn drop in feature, temporarily saved the files in temp location, then apply the compression technique based on the selected algorithm provided as a dorpdown in the UI.

while compression is going on, provide the progress bar and once done share the file in the UI as output, once user click the download button then only stream the data to the client, also make the UI smooth and futuristic like Google website itself.

For teh compression algorithm, create an interface which all the algorithms needs to implment for working and implement some basic compressiton techniques. like 7zip, huffman coding, PAQ, use different libraries if required.

if some algorithms require input params, pass them using the UI.
